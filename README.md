## Champlain College Senior Capstone   
Team Members: Brianna Guest, Isaac Reeves, Liam Sweeney  
Advisors: Devin Paden, Elizabeth Allen-Pennebaker


### The Topic
This capstone will feature the designing and management of a home network created in the likeness of a business that will be monitored using a SIEM. This would involve using a list of the IP addresses on the network and monitoring the general data of our apartment.

### Overview
Our team has taken a liking to this idea in particular because not only does it allow us to secure our own network while we work on it, but also allows us a hands-on experience of managing a network. Brianna and Isaac are quite interested in the Sysadmin direction of this project, causing them to be interested in the evaluation and creation of user roles and the needs of the network. Liam on the other hand enjoys the ideas of looking into the threats that will be recorded in the SIEM and the logs created by the systems. By looking into these topics, we as a team would learn the complexities of managing and adapting to the needs of the network and the business of the people using it.

### Topic description
This project would begin with the restructuring of the network to incorporate the use of switches. This would allow us to logically divide the network and subnet the computers by floor into different physical groups. The second step would include preparing a SIEM in a cloud environment. This would allow us to monitor the machines on the network from anywhere by forwarding the logs to an offsite location. Finally, we would begin by restructuring the user accounts on our network by creating new user profiles that can be managed at each machine. Additional goals include segmenting the network by adding a VYOS firewall, closing ports on our main router, constructing a server for data management, and securing machines from outside threats.
